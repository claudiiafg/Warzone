# Warzone

In order for the Game to work we must import the files from directory /testing, 
which is done differently depending of you operating system

Please check Maploader::loadMaps() and input your path under the 'ta' case

    For mac you can use relative paths: './testing/'
    For windows please use full path : 'C:/Users/...'
